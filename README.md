## Overview

This npm package provides a database of Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket cards and sets (Pokemon TCG Pocket). 
It includes three JSON files: `cards.json`, `sets.json` and `rarity.json` which contain detailed information about the cards and sets, respectively.

## Installation

To install the package, use the following command:

```bash
npm install -D pokemon-tcg-pocket-database
```

## Usage

### Importing the Database

You can import the database into your project using the following code:

```js
import sets from "pokemon-tcg-pocket-database/dist/sets.json";
import cards from "pokemon-tcg-pocket-database/dist/cards.json";
import rarity from "pokemon-tcg-pocket-database/dist/rarity.json";
```

### Accessing the Data

The `cards.json` file contains an array of card objects, each with the following properties:

- `set`: The set code of the card.
- `number`: The card number within the set.
- `rarity`: The rarity of the card.
- `rarityCode`: The rarity code of the card.
- `imageName`: The name of the card image file.
- `label`: An object containing the slug and English name of the card.
- `packs`: An array of packs where the card can be found.

Rarity codes are as follows (use `rarity.json` for this mapping):

- C: "Common",
- U: "Uncommon",
- R: "Rare",
- RR: "Double Rare",
- SR: "Super Rare",
- AR: "Art Rare",
- SAR: "Special Art Rare",
